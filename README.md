## Sammy
#### *Accessibility Media Player*

Sammy is a smart media player that enables understanding of videos for the visually-disabled and quicker navigation for everyone.

- ✨ Sammy is a multimedia player that can help you find, in a video, anything from a simple phrase that was spoken to a scene that you can describe in words.
- ✨ We combined OCR (Optical Character Recognition), ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and Scene Understanding (SDD) to describe the scene taking place in the video and to make this information searchable.

### WHAT ARE WE SOLVING?
Imagine a world where even specially-enabled people are able to understand and navigate through video content and where nobody has to spend ages searching for a single line in hour-long videos.
Today, we don’t have a system to make the content inside videos searchable and describable. Videos/movies for the optically disabled have to be professionally voiced through an expensive process, making them inaccessible. This lack of a system is also a problem when one is trying to pick up a small piece of information in a long video.

### Features

- Can search for a particular phrase through your voice
- It can Describe the video with voice and text
- Users can upload a video of their choice
